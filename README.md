# odin-recipes
Hello! This project is my first one on the odin project course, I have already tried to start programming before but here and now I am completely decided to get serious in this and not quiting anymore.

My project is about some venezuelan recipes (I am venezuelan), it's description, ingredients and preparation. When I learn new things I'll come back to get this site better and better.
