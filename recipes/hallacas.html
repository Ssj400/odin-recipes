    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>To make the guiso crudo (filling), cut the beef, pork and bacon in small pieces. Place everything in a large
            container or pot that has a lid. Add the onion, sweet pepper, green pepper, green onion and garlic. Season
            with oregano, salt, cumin,
            garlic powder , pepper, cooking wine and vegetable oil. Mix well. Cover and let marinate overnight in the
            refrigerator, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>To prepare the leaves, sash with water; wiping them clean with a damp cloth and wiping them with a dry one.
            Divide the leaves in two types: one that's the main one (the biggest one) which is where you have to place
            the dough and hallaca filling and the second leaf (smaller one) that covers, encloses and protects the tamal
            while is cooking. You should remove the center stem from the leaves with a kitchen shears since this
            prevents them from bending easily. Be careful not to break the leaf while you remove the stem.</li>

        <li>To make the dough, heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add the pork fat and annatto grains. Let the pork fat
            dissolve and the annatto to render its color. Remove from the stove and let cool. In a large container, add
            the corn meal and incorporate little by little with the chicken broth and softened butter. Knead vigorously
            and add the pork fat with annatto and salt as desired. The dough has to be soft and a yellow color. Divide
            the dough in 50 equal balls.</li>

        <li>To fill the hallacas, dampen a large plantain leaf with a bit of vegetable oil. Place one ball of dough in
            the middle of a leaf. Extend the dough in a circular motion with your hands until it is 1/4 inch thick. Add
            one and a half tablespoons of guiso crudo with its juice in the center of the dough. On top of the filling,
            place 2 onion rings, 1 pepper strip, one parsley sprig, 3 raisins, 2 chickpeas, 2 capers, 2 olives and a
            small piece of bacon.</li>

        <li>To fold the hallacas, take the wider edges of the leaf and fold them upward. Create a fold until it is
            completely sealed. Fold the other two ends towards the inside and wrap it with the smaller leaf. Tie the
            hallacas with the previously cut kitchen twine. Cross them three times in each direction (horizontal and
            vertical) and close with a knot or bow.</li>
        <img src="../media/hallacas/hallacas_folding.jpg" alt="Folding the hallacas" width="400" height="300">
        <li>In a large pot, boil 8 gallons of water at high heat. Place about half of the hallacas into the boiling
            water, cover and cook over low heat for 1 1/2 hours. Repeat the process with the other hallacas or you can
            use two pots at the same time.</li>
        <img src="../media/hallacas/hallacas_boiling.jpg" alt="Boiling the hallacas" width="300" height="300">
        <li>Remove and drain hallacas, preferably in the vertical position. Let cool and refrigerate until you are ready
            to eat. Since they take a lot of work, the custom is to prepare large quantities of hallacas. These tamales
            can be kept in the fridge for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 6 months.</li>
        <li>When you need to heat the hallacas again, thaw in refrigerator overnight if frozen. Boil water in a deep pot
            at high heat. Add the hallacas you wish to reheat (make sure the water is covering them). Lower the heat to
            medium and cook for 20 minutes. Remove the pot from the stove. Drain the hallacas, cut the twine, remove the
            leaf and enjoy!</li>
