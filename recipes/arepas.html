    <h1>Arepas</h1>
    <h2>What is an arepa?</h2>
    <p>
        Arepas are cornmeal cakes that originated
        hundreds of years ago in a region that now
        makes up Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama.
        Traditionally, they were cooked on a pan called
        a budare. But they can also be grilled, baked, or fried.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>This recipe only needs thirty minutes, one bowl and three ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Salt</b></li>
        <li><b>Oil for cooking</b></li>
        <li><b>Areparina or masarepa (which is a special pre-cooked corn flour specifically for making arepas)</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve salt into the water and slowly add the masarepa until a loose dough forms, stirring with a spoon or
            your hands.</li>

        <li>Once you get your dough where it should be, let it rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>After those 5 minutes, scoop out fist-size portions and form into a ball. If the edges crack easily
            or it feels too dry, add a little more water to moisten. It’s a simple dough to work with. Then it’s as easy
            as rolling into balls and gently forming / smashing into discs.</li>

        <li>Once your arepas are formed, simply pan-fry in a little oil to form
            a crust (a little deep blackening is OK!), and then finish in the oven to ensure
            the centers are cooked through (optional but recommended). Then enjoy!</li>
